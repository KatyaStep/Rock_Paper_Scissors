        <h1>HANNIBAL - THE BATTLE OF CANNAE </h1>
        <p>The Battle of Cannae was a major battle of the Second Punic War that took place on 2 August 216
            BC in Apulia, in southeast Italy. The army of Carthage, under Hannibal, surrounded and decisively
            defeated a larger army of the Roman Republic under the consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius
            Terentius Varro. It is regarded both as one of the greatest tactical feats in military history and 
            as one of the worst defeats in Roman history.</p>
         <h1>STRATEGIC BACKGROUND </h1>
         <p>Shortly after the start of the Second Punic War, Hannibal crossed into Italy by traversing 
             the Pyrenees and the Alps during the summer and early autumn of 218 BC.He quickly won
              major victories over the Romans at Trebia and at Lake Trasimene.After these losses, 
              the Romans appointed Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus as dictator to deal with the threat.
              Fabius used attrition warfare against Hannibal, cutting off his supply lines and avoiding 
              pitched battles. These tactics proved unpopular with the Romans who, as they recovered from 
              the shock of Hannibal's victories, began to question the wisdom of the Fabian strategy, 
              which had given the Carthaginian army a chance to regroup.The majority of Romans were 
              eager to see a quick conclusion to the war. It was feared that, if Hannibal continued 
              plundering Italy unopposed, Rome's allies might defect to the Carthaginian side for 
              self-preservation.</p>
